# AndyRep
Welcome to my repository.
This repository will mainly be used to share my projects that I produce while attending
"The College University at Buskerud and Vestfold" in the year 2016, but feel free to look through my files,
and comment if you like.

I doubt you will find any break-neck revolutionary code wizardry here, but I try my best, and have alot of fun while doing it.
