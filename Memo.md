Subject: Concerns regarding tools.

Mr. Ovrum
We have researched the possibility of using the game engine “Unity 5” as a developing tool in this year’s curriculum, as you had concerns regarding some of its functionality.
For the most part the answers to your questions are: Yes.
Unity5 functions in such a way so that it is possible to take full advantage of the graphic rendering without it interfering with the physics we are meant to practice.
The game engine does come with complete physics assets, but one does not have to use them in order for the rest of the assets and mechanics to work.
A Unity5 project functions in such a way, that the developer can drop game objects into a scene without any physic attributes attached and thus leaves it all upon the developer to write the scripts manipulating the game objects to behave in the proper fashion.
So to surmise; The physics within Unity5 is optional, and any equation can be simulated within a game objects by writing your own scripts.

I also believe that it should be our go to tool as it is a tool that the students already are familiar with and since it utilizes CSharp for its scripts. CSharp being one of the languages used in "*Physics for game programmers*" by Grant Palmer, makes the necessity for interpretation of any example code minimal and should therefore ease any confusion students might encounter by switching syntax when trying to understand the purpose of written scripts.

If another tool is to be preferred it should probably be something along the lines of “Pygame”, “SDL” or the already inbuilt libraries within Java, so that the developers use minimal time fiddling with how to display graphics and more on the subject of utilizing physics within a simulated environment.
We strongly recommend however that we stick to Unity5 as it fulfills the requirements you have set for this class. Should however something unforeseen issues emerge, a change of developing tool would not be catastrophically as there are several solutions that fit the bill, and we as engineering students should be able to adapt quickly in order to compensate if the situation requires it.
